## Photography

Photography should always be genuine. Be that people or activities. Ideally we want to convey movement and or community to our demographic. Some motion blur or out of focus elements are okay because movement isn’t staged, it’s messy and real.

<div class="frame">
    <Imag src={img1} alt="Examples of photograpy style." aspectRatio="247:100" format="jpg" width={1200}/>
</div>

## Image Overlay

When using the full colour logos, the background shapes must be used. 

Overlays for the images become optional as the logo itself has sufficient contrast to meet accessibility standards.

We prefer the primary logo over the alternative, and for it to be left aligned over the image. The standard logo clear space rules apply here.

<div class="frame">
    <Imag src={img2} alt="Examples of overlay style." aspectRatio="178:100" format="jpg" width={1200}/>
</div>
