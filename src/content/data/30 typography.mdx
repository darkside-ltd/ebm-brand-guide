## Atkinson Hyperlegible

Named after the founder of the Braille Institute, J. Robert Atkinson, was developed specifically to increase legibility for readers with low vision, and to improve comprehension.

Having a traditional grotesque sans-serif at its core, it departs from tradition to incorporate unambiguous, distinctive elements—and at times, unexpected forms—always with the goal of increasing character recognition and ultimately improve reading.

## Typeface features

For Low vision readers – certain letters and numbers can be hard to distinguish from one another. Atkinson Hyperlegible differentiates common misinterpreted letters and numbers using various design techniques:

<div class="frame">
    <Imag src={img2} alt="Type sample 1." format="jpg" />
</div>



### Recognisable Footprints 

Character boundaries clearly defined, ensuring understanding across the visual-ability spectrum.

### Differentiated letterforms

Similar letter pairs are differentiated from each other to dramatically increase legibility.

<div class="frame">
    <Imag src={img3} alt="Type sample 2." format="jpg" />
</div>



### Unambiguous Characters

Designed to increase legibility and distinction.

<div class="frame">
    <Imag src={img4} alt="Type sample 3." format="jpg" />
</div>


### Exaggerated forms
Shaping of letters is exaggerated to provide better clarity.

<div class="frame">
    <Imag src={img5} alt="Type sample 4." format="jpg" />
</div>


### Opened Counterspace
Open areas of certain letters are expanded to provide greater distinction.

<div class="frame">
    <Imag src={img6} alt="Type sample 5." format="jpg" />
</div>

### Angled spurs and differentiated tails
Increase recognition and define distinctive style.

## Hierarchy

We use an WCAG compliant base size of 16px == 1em and the Major Third (1.250) to scale type.

While this hierarchy is intended to bring harmony to vertical rhythm in the typographic design. The rules are best applied when working with long-form written content. And often aren’t required for marketing materials.

Accessibility over aesthetics.

<div class="frame">
    <Imag src={img7} alt="Type Scales." format="svg" />
</div>

## Layouts
Here you can see how our hierarchy is used. It’s clearly legible digitally and in print. And it will be used for both display headings and body text.

<div class="frame">
    <Imag src={img8} alt="Type Layouts." format="jpg" />
</div>


### Line Height
Display Headings: 1em to 1.2em.
Paragraphs: 1.4 to 1.68em.


## Web Implementation

To provide the best possible experience when using our website our primary font should be set to load optionally. And we provide a series of fallback fonts to honour user preference when custom fonts may have been set at the browser or operating system level. 

``` css
body {
font-family: 'Atkinson Hyperlegible', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Helvetica Neue, Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, Segoe UI Symbol, sans-serif;
}
