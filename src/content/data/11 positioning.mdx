## The Heroes Journey

### Who they are

Mark is a 40-year-old man who has been living with a physical disability for the past five years. 

He was an avid runner and enjoyed going to the gym regularly. However, since his disability, he has found it challenging to find exercises and workout routines that he can safely and comfortably do.

He fears judgement if they were to exercise, but also has anxiety around what to expect and expectations upon them once they are there. 
Logistics also contribute to this anxiety. 

As such, he doesn't exercise much, but has been thinking about it more, especially since his family has recommended that he move more.

Currently, he feels stuck at home. He understands this is not good for his physical or mental health.

He needs more assurances that the clubs and sessions are a permanent fixture in his life should he want to continue and that there are no expectations or signs-ups if he doesn't want to continue. 

He needs to know that the activities are accessible and inclusive, non-judgemental, and not overly competitive. 

### Call to action

His daughter learns about Every Body Moves from her Instagram account. 

He spends some time on his laptop looking at the website. 

He spends a long time on social proof because he is searching for stories that are similar to his own to see if those experiences were positive. 

Subconsciously he considers his list of initial objections; accessibility, culture, expectations, logistics, and integrity of the service. 

He knows they need to do something, he's been feeling frustrated, and it would make those that care about him feel good to know that he was doing something. 

It would also be nice to get out and about. 

He signs up for something with minimal commitment. 

The website is easy to navigate and make a booking with the local club. His spirits lift as this is a good sign.


### What do they achieve?
The session is well run, and fears about accessibility or judgement are allayed. 

He connects with several members who share their experiences and offer advice and support. Mark begins to feel like he's not alone and that there are people who understand his struggles.

He asks some questions about the level of commitment they would need because he doesn't always feel up to it, or logistically he doesn't have the support to come every week. 

After the session, he feels really excited and, physically, he feels good; he's smiling and looking forward to the next session. 

In fact, he is making those plans already. 

Nerves about his physical ability or mental capacity to follow along and take part are gone; he feels an equal in the room. 

With the help of the community, Mark starts to explore different exercises and workout routines that are safe and comfortable for him. He sets small goals for himself and starts to see progress, both physically and mentally. 

Mark feels a sense of empowerment and accomplishment that he hasn't felt in years.

### What challenge is overcome?
He overcomes physical and mental challenges and barriers to becoming active in a way that suits him. 

He becomes part of a community, with no expectations or judgement, where he can enjoy being himself and have fun, without feeling self-conscious.

Goal: he becomes healthier, mentally and physically, because He is active and has taken the first step to building on this, if that's what he wants, and at their own pace. 

He is empowered by his success and by his drive to overcome the barriers to this success. 

He is proud of himself for facing this discomfort/fear head-on. 


### New Challenges

Will he go back? What if he feels unwell, or something comes up? The motivation to go back wanes over the week, the voice creeps back and the old challenges arise. Does he have the energy to go back weekly, does he have the space for this in his life? 

As Mark continues on his journey, he faces challenges and setbacks. 

There are times when he feels discouraged and wants to give up. However, he remembers the support and encouragement of the community, and he pushes through. 

Mark discovers new exercises and workouts that he never thought he could do, and he surprises himself with his strength and resilience.

His 'old world' looks small now in comparison, he has had fun, and he sees the potential for friendship and community, it felt physically good, with no pressure or expectations, the thought of judgement was scary, but the reality was enlightening.

It was nice to be in that place, it's a safe place, but a place that felt right. 

### New World
Through his journey, Mark realises that his disability doesn't have to define him. He discovers a new sense of identity as someone strong, determined, and capable. 

Mark becomes a leader in the community, helping others who are struggling to find their path. 

He feels a sense of purpose and fulfilment that he never thought possible.

Now he has started to become active; he is feeling healthier, less worried, and emboldened by the fact that he has been doing something he thought he couldn't, or that he was nervous to attempt.

He is motivated to master new skills, and be part of new groups and communities. 

He feels physically and mentally better. 



## Emotional Territory

Our mission to connect disabled people with communities and activities is at the heart of the brand's "why". 

To reach a broader audience, Every Body Moves needs to tell a story that emotionally relates to people's lives and not just their desire to be more active. 

As we know there is a proportion of the audience who don't want, or don't feel empowered, to move more. 

We need a brand story that connects to a deep human truth. One that's personally felt. Most people know they should exercise, but that is not always enough to motivate them to do so. 

Every Body Moves has its benefits related to improving physical well-being, but also to emotional well-being and belonging to a community.
 
Every Body Moves is also bettering society by raising the profile and voices of disabled people by improving and creating centres for physical activity. 

These benefits connect to the idea of belonging. The problem that Every Body Moves solves for people is not offering accessible physical activity. It's that the disabled community feels alone, judged, shut out, and cut off from mainstream activities. The desire is for the community, without judgement, to enjoy good company and have fun. 

And that's what Every Body Moves offers, through connecting disabled people with sessions and advising more clubs on how to be accessible and inclusive. It's a different experience being around other people, and not feeling like the 'only one'. You're more likely to stay in a club that makes you feel at ease, you're more likely to be more active.
