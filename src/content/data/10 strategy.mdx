## Purpose

### Why We Do What We Do

We're committed to reaching every disabled person across the UK. By bringing communities together we provide a platform and the resources to empower disabled people to be more active and become co producers in creating fully inclusive cultures.

People are at the heart of Every Body Moves, we believe in building each other up, celebrating our successes and sharing our stories to empower all disabled people to move in a way that works for us.

We're redefining what it means to move. We believe there is an activity out there for everybody.

**Because Every Body Moves.**

The sad truth is that only one in five disabled people took part in organised physical activity in 2022, and less than three in ten felt encouraged to return to sport and physical activity.

Many disabled people struggle to find accessible and inclusive activities near them, leading to feelings of isolation and loneliness.

Despite this, 82% of those with a disability and/or condition recognise the importance of physical activity and sport. They cite reasons such as improving physical and mental health, and boosting self-esteem.

At the same time, disabled people are almost twice as likely as non-disabled people to say they can't find inclusive activities near them, and twice as likely to feel lonelier and more isolated than before the pandemic.

That's why we believe in the power of inclusive communities to help break down these barriers and make physical activity accessible to all.


## Mission

> To connect the disabled community to inclusive and accessible physical activities across the UK, sharing the lived experiences, moments of fun, and important knowledge that will break down barriers and empower disabled people to move more. 



## Values

### How does the way we operate reflect our values?

#### We're accessible
We are removing barriers to inclusion and creating equal opportunities for access to physical activity and social engagement. 

We empower the disabled community and their networks by providing comprehensive and accurate information about local activities and groups.

Through our commitment to accessibility, we are creating a world where every disabled person can find and enjoy physical activity. 

#### We're inclusive
We believe that everybody deserves to feel welcome and included in physical activity and social engagement.  

We recognise that accessibility alone is not enough and that true inclusivity requires greater understanding to inform and educate ourselves and others to embrace inclusion more widely.

We are creating a world where every disabled person feels valued, supported, and able to participate fully in society.  


#### We're collaborative
We believe that working together is the key to creating positive change for the disabled community. We collaborate in everything we do, from engaging with local organisations to designing our platform. 

We recognise that no single organisation or individual can address the complex challenges facing disabled people alone, and we are dedicated to building strong, mutually beneficial relationships with our stakeholders. 

We proactively seek to collaborate to create a culture of communication and partnership that empowers the disabled community to share their expertise and insights and to work together towards common goals.


#### We're celebratory
We recognise and celebrate the diversity and achievements of the disabled community, and we believe that their stories and successes should be shared and celebrated.

Through our platform, we promote a culture of acceptance and understanding and highlight the lived experiences of disabled individuals who have overcome obstacles and achieved their goals.
