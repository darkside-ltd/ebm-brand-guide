## Purpose

### Why We Do What We Do

We're committed to reaching every disabled person across the UK. By bringing
communities together we provide a platform and the resources to empower disabled people to be
more active and become co producers in creating fully inclusive cultures.

People are at the heart of Every Body Moves, we believe in building each other up, celebrating our
successes and sharing our stories to empower all disabled people to move in a way that works for us.

We're redefining what it means to move. We believe there is an activity out there for
everybody.

Because Every Body Moves.

The sad truth is that only one in five disabled people took part in organised physical activity in 2022, and
less than three in ten felt encouraged to return to sport and physical activity.

Many disabled people struggle to find accessible and inclusive activities near them, leading to feelings of
isolation and loneliness.

Despite this, 82% of those with a disability and/or condition recognise the importance of physical activity
and sport. They cite reasons such as improving physical and mental health, and boosting self-esteem.

At the same time, disabled people are almost twice as likely as non-disabled people to say they can't find
inclusive activities near them, and twice as likely to feel lonelier and more isolated than before the pandemic.

That's why we believe in the power of inclusive communities to help break down these barriers and make
physical activity accessible to all.


## Vision

### The Future Vision

Our vision is a world where inclusion is the status quo and active lifestyles are accessible to all
disabled people.

We strive to break down barriers and create opportunities for every disabled person to move
more, to improve their physical and mental health, and to live their lives to the fullest.

We believe that every person, regardless of their abilities, deserves the chance to participate
fully in society and reach their full potential.

We're committed to making this vision a reality by providing support, resources,
and advocacy for disabled people, and by fostering a culture of acceptance and understanding.

### Our Vision

> Empowering every body to move through the creation and championing of inclusive cultures where active lifestyles are accessible to all disabled people.

> Empowering every disabled person in the UK to move more.

> Every disabled person moving more.

## Values

### What Do We Hold Dear In How We Operate?

#### We're accessible
We believe in removing barriers to inclusion and finding activties that meet
our community where they are. 

We believe that everyone deserves equal access to
opportunities for physical activity and social engagement, regardless of their abilities. 

We're committed to promoting and advising on accessibility in everything we do, from designing our
platform to partnering with local organisations.

We strive to empower disabled people and their networks by providing comprehensive and
accurate information about local activities and communities, and by advocating for more
inclusive and accessible options.

By valuing accessibility, we hope to create a world where every disabled person can find and
enjoy the activities that bring them joy and fulfilment.

#### We're inclusive
We believe that everyone deserves to feel welcome and included in physical
activity and social engagement, regardless of their abilities or background.

We recognise that accessibility alone is not enough, and that true inclusivity requires a culture of
acceptance, understanding, and respect.

By valuing inclusivity, we hope to create a world where every disabled person feels valued,
supported, and able to participate fully in society.


#### We're collaborative
We believe that working together is the key to creating positive change
for disabled people.

We're committed to fostering collaboration and partnership in everything
we do, from engaging with local organisations to designing our platform.

We recognise that no single organisation or individual can address the complex challenges facing
disabled people alone, and we're dedicated to building strong, mutually beneficial relationships
with our stakeholders.

We strive to create a culture of collaboration that empowers disabled people and their networks
to share their expertise and insights, and to work together towards common goals.

By valuing collaboration, we hope to create a more inclusive and connected community that
benefits all disabled people.

#### We're celebratory
We recognise and celebrate the diversity and achievements of disabled
people, and we believe that their stories and successes should be shared and celebrated.

Through our platform, we strive to promote a culture of acceptance and understanding, and to
highlight the inspiring stories of disabled individuals who have overcome obstacles and achieved
their goals, no matter the size.

We're committed to providing a platform that empowers disabled people to share their stories
and connect with others, while promoting the benefits of physical activity and social
engagement.

By valuing celebration, we hope to inspire more disabled people to move more.


## Audience

Our audience faces a unique challenge. Not only can finding exercise clubs that have been adapted to their needs be difficult, they
may also struggle to find a welcoming and inclusive environment that accommodates their individual needs and abilities. Disabled
people and their communities are looking for a safe and comfortable space to workout and stay active.

For our audience, it's important to do research and ask questions before joining. Knowing the accommodations and adaptations
they offer, the specialised equipment or trainers who are trained in adaptive exercises is important. it is equally important them to
have a high levels of detail prior to attending in order to accomodate logistics in advance. An absence of this increases anxiety
levels.

Our audience may struggle with motivation, to go initially or return. Having a community and developing a sense of belonging is
crucial in raising motivation and offering support.

Their motivations for being more active are to be healthier, if not for themselves but for the benefit of their loved ones.

Fear of judgement features in their decision making process. A key desire is to live their lives without this and be more proactive in
crafting a more equitable world.

## Difference

### What Makes Us Different?

EBM brings a unique set of strengths to the table. With our ability and resources to work we have a wide reach across the UK which
enables us to connect disabled people and their networks with a diverse range of activities and communities.

We're committed to promoting inclusivity in all forms of activity and movement, and are proud to be associated with trusted brands such
as PGB and Toyota, which adds trust and confidence in the quality and integrity of our programme.

We celebrate all movement, and our comprehensive approach covers all impairments, making us a trusted resource for disabled people
throughout the UK.

Our unique offering sets us apart from anything similar in other countries, and there is currently nothing in the UK that covers all
impairments in the same way.

Finally, we believe in the power of collaboration and co-production. We speak to the disabled community to inform progress and growth,
ensuring that our platform remains responsive to the needs and desires of the people we serve. By bringing together our strengths in
partnership, inclusivity, and collaboration, we're committed to creating a world where every disabled person has the opportunity to
thrive and live their best life.

### Emotional Territory

Our mission to connect disabled people with communities and activities is at the heart of the brand's "why".

To reach a broader audience EBM needs to tell a story that emotionally relates to people's lives and not just their desire to be more
active. As we know there is a proportion of the audience who don't want, or don't feel empowered, to move more.

You need a brand story that connects to a deep human truth. One that's personally felt. Most people know they should exercise, but that
is not always enough to motivate them to do so.

EBM has its benefits related to improving physical wellbeing, but also to emotional wellbeing and belonging to a community. EBM is also
bettering society through raising the profile and voices of disabled people via sports and activity based environments.

These benefits connect to the idea of belonging. The problem that EBM solves for people is not offering accessible sports. It's that
disabled people feel alone, judged, shut out and cut off from mainstream activities. They could move more at home, but really they want
to be around others, where they are not judged, where they do not stand out, in order to enjoy good company and have fun.

And that's what EBM offers, through connecting disabled people with clubs, and advising more clubs on how to be accessible and inclusive. It's a
different experience being around other people, not feeling like the 'only one'. You're more likely to stay in a club that makes you feel at ease,
you're more likely to be more active.
