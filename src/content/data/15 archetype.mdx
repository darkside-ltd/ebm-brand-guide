## Everyman

- Faithful
- Supportive

### Motto

All people are treated equally.

> "Ring the bells that still can ring; forget your perfect offering. 
There is a crack in everything; that's how the light gets in."
> <cite>Leonard cohen</cite>

Driven by the need to feel a sense of belonging, the Everyman believes that everyone matters equally, regardless if status, age, ethnicity or creed. Like a good neighbour, the Everyman seeks to do the right thing, with no need for heroics or adventure. This archetype understands that joy can be found in what may be called ordinary or normal, and sees the virtue in the appreciation of each moment for it's own sake. Presenting little artifice, the Everyman is practical down to earth, accessible, dependable, kind, and in general can be described as "real."

Distinct from concepts connoting social division (commoner, common people, masses), the Everyman represents the universal, unpretentious experience of being a member of the human race - the bitter, the sweet, and the depths of both joy and sorrow. This archetype believes that underneath the trappings of society is a shared core of humanity that is grounded, unselfish, and friendly. 

Possessing a charming sincerity, Everyman embodies the acronym WYSIWYG - what you see is what you get - and has a casual approach to life, preferring to be understated, nonthreatening and helpful to all. 


## Networker

### Strengths

- Creating Community and Connections
- Empathy
- Conversation
  
### Motto

Bring people together to affect change.

> "You have everything you need to build something far bigger than yourself."
> <cite>Seth Godin, In Tribes</cite>

The Networker creates communities of collaborative peers. Operating as a hub, this archetype is motivated by an intuitive knowledge of peoples unique skills and differentiating aspects.  The Networker finds meaning in knowing many people, finding commonalities between them and is motivated to expand its sphere of influence by forging alliances and making connections within disparate groups of people.  This archetype demonstrates an emotional sensitivity to the needs of other people. Sometimes seen as a social butterfly, the Networker is generally quite good at putting people at ease, telling stories and making friends. 

Social media has created a whole new playing field for the Networker, allowing for continents and cultures to be crossed. Offering access to the zeitgeist, a ready stream of stimulus and response, exposure to new ideas further's the Networker's power.

The Networker is cultured, socially facile and has a broad knowledge base. With an easy laugh and the ability to make others feel good. The Networker brings information, power and inspiration to spread ideas and spark change across a broad spectrum. By knowing the right people, the Networker is a powerful facilitator to make things happen.


## Speaking to the everyman

What this means in real terms...

This archetype wants to belong, to find it's tribe of people and stay there. To this end, they need to understand your brand substance in order to make that connection. 

There are several levels to this belonging too, superficially it's making a connection because of a product - the car you drive speaks to your character and they enjoy sharing how much they love this vehicle with other owners. At a deeper level it's about politics, patriotism, faith. 

This archetype wants to be friends. Literally. They want to advocate for you, they just need the reason to. The flip side is any changes to the brand, product or service can land a heavy blow. 

Even as the world becomes smaller, the problem of loneliness is persistent. This means that our archetype looks for connections elsewhere, including commercial transactions. 

Offering a point of connection for people will greatly enhance loyalty. 

The archetype is affable. They are not a demographic or lifestyle, more a deep need in everyone to belong somewhere. 

In this sense, the everyman is a vehicle for connection as much as an identity.  By placing belonging at the very centre of the brand. This archetype tells it's audience they are great as they are. It meets their audience where they are, and doesn't seek to change them, but enhance them.


### The everyman is good for your brand if...

- You help people belong.
- Your product or serivce is designed for everyday life.
- Your identity is egalitarian and inclusive.
  

### The everyman sub family

Sometimes an archetype feels like a best-fit. That's ok, but bear in mind there are archetypes within the head of the family that are more nuanced and offer even more guidance on the parameters and personality of the archetype.

- Advocate
- Citizen
- Networker
- Servant

Above is a diagram of motivational theory, designed to be a quick diagnostic test for recognising the underlying motivation of the customers and the brand identity, with the four major human drives positioned along two axis: Belonging / People versus Independence / Self-Actualisation, and Stability/ Control versus Risk/Mastery. 

In everyday human terms, this means that most people want to be liked and to belong to a group. At the same time, we also want to be individuals and go our own way. The Hero in our archetypal mix is the small voice within each of us, or the voice of the brand, saying you can be courageous on your journey to actualisation. 

The fear for customers in these archetypes is standing out or being rejected. The Everyman (Brand) has a key motivation to help people feel connection.
