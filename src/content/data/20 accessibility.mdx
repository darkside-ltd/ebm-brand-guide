## The Social Model of Disability

Every Body moves, as a British Paralympic Association programme uses the social model of disability. This model was developed by disabled people and says that disability is caused by barriers within society, rather than by someone's impairment.

For example, a wheelchair user would be unable to enter a building that requires a step to enter. The social model recognises that this is a problem with the building, not the person or their impairment, and would suggest adding a ramp to the entrance.

Barriers can be physical or be caused by people's attitudes based on prejudice or stereotypes, like assuming disabled people can't do certain things.

The social model helps us recognise barriers that make life harder for disabled people. Removing these barriers creates equality.


## Language

**Words to use and avoid**

Avoid passive, victim words. Use language that respects disabled people as active individuals with control over their own lives.

## General Guidance


- Use a minimum of size 12 font.
- Avoid cursive fonts.
- Avoid using italics.
- Align text to the left.
- Only use underline for link text, avoid using elsewhere - including for headings.
- For headings and other emphasis, use bold.
- Avoid using all uppercase text - particularly for large bodies of text.
- Use plain language and an active voice. Write in short sentences and avoid metaphorical language. You can use a readability tool like [Hemingway App](https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/z_qICL9wqfPO5DCBgp-V?domain=hemingwayapp.com/) to help you.
- Ensure high colour contrast between text and background. You can use [WebAIM checker](https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/Uq-8CM8xrI58GyFkS7_P?domain=webaim.org/) to check that colour contrast is sufficient.
- Include descriptive link text. Avoid using a copy and pasted URL and phrases like ‘click here’ or ‘read more’ as the link text. Here’s more helpful tips to write [accessible link text](https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/U4H-CXD2JTnN3PtQh-e-?domain=bighack.org/).
- Use appropriate [heading structure and in a logical order](https://business.scope.org.uk/article/how-to-write-better-link-text-for-accessibility).
- Ensure all videos have subtitles. With subtitles on a solid colour background, not over the moving background of a video.
- Ensure pictures contain alt-text descriptions – including images of graphs and charts. For images with copy, ensure that the alt-text contains the same words as in the image.
    - However, decorative images on websites or documents shouldn’t have alt-text, instead, they should be marked as decorative or have ‘null’ code (alt=””) in the CMS.
    - Here are some tips on how to [write better alt-text descriptions for accessibility](https://business.scope.org.uk/article/how-to-write-better-alt-text-descriptions-for-accessibility) and how to avoid these common alt-text mistakes.

## Accessibility for Spreadsheets

Tops tips for Excel and other spreadsheets.


- Have text in Cell A1
- Avoid blank cells, columns, and rows. If there is no need for a blank cell, column, or row, consider deleting it. If you cannot avoid a blank cell, column, or row, enter text explaining that it is blank. For example, type N/A or Intentionally Blank.
